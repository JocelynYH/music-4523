                    <p>In the video, A Hard Fela to Follow: The Origin Story of Afrobeat, we interview some students to discuss the narrative of Fela Kutiâ€™s Afrobeat. Through this process, interviewees are asked a series of questions that deal with Afrobeat and Afrobeats. With this engaging dialogue, interviewees analyze Fela's work and songs that have sampled his work. Ultimately, the interviewees are asked whether these Afrobeats' songs are paying homage to Fela or just a strategic ploy to get more viewers?</p>
