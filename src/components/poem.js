                  i can’t see myself in you
                  <br/>
                  even when you spit truth unriddled by feminism
                  <br/>
                  and supposed upheaval of burden
                  <br/>
                  racism
                  <br/>
                  i don’t know if i should apologize
                  <br/>
                  that gets us nowhere
                  <br/>
                  deliberately derails your voice

                  <br/> <br/>

                  you’re a world away and i try my best
                  <br/>
                  but my mind will stay detached attached unlatched
                  <br/>
                  analytical i want this to stick
                  <br/>
                  it means more than you think it does
                  <br/>

                  <br/>
                  i am a woman
                  <br/>
                  solidly hollow
                  <br/>
                  unseen and supposedly scenic
                  <br/>
                  something to look at it

                  <br/>
                  you deserve more

                  that fleeting feelings of justness
                  <br/>

                  goddess of us all
                  <br/>
                  why don’t we listen to you more?

                  <br/> <br/>

                  alone
                  <br/>
                  supposed to fit in
                  <br/>
                  i see your faces in the sounds i hear
                  <br/>
                  purple catalysts in dense hues
                  <br/>
                  something worth listening to
                  <br/>

                  <br/> <br/>

                  and i know that if i love somebody

                  care about them
                  <br/>
                  what i do i must fight for their rights
                  <br/>
                  it will be on my conscience forevers
                  <br/>
                  i will not consume the art of black bodies without fighting for their liberation
                  <br/>
                  i am disempowered oppressed but i will not be silent, wild hair out i relate to you i see your

                  <br/>
                  and we will coexist and love uplift each other because we are not subhuman but humans rising

                  goddesses golden not pale white blonde small

                  <br/> <br/>

                  i do not know you but i want to not through boxes or ticks congratulations diversity but because
                  <br/>
                  of the air you breathe who you are

                  <br/> <br/>

                  i will not sit idly by
                  <br/>
                  pretend that i know a history i learned in class
                  <br/>
                  but my mouth didn’t calibrate
                  <br/>
                  or steps didn’t take
                  <br/>
                  but here is my promise
                  <br/>
                  to african electronic music
                  <br/>
                  to you
                  <br/>
                  to two fused worlds
                  <br/>
                  of globalization
                  <br/>
                  with pain

                  attribution
                  <br/>
                  contribution
                  <br/>
                  i want to better you
                  <br/>
                  i do not want my story to take over
                  <br/>
                  the loopholes in the narrative
                  <br/>
                  my pointing out
                  <br/>
                  i will not colonize
                  <br/>
                  how do i educate
                  <br/>
                  through my voice
                  <br/>
                  my footsteps on cement filled ground
                  <br/>
                  on white grounds

                  <br/> <br/>

                  so to combine a place of my world
                  <br/>
                  in which i find the human voice surrounded my audio
                  <br/>
                  technology
                  <br/>
                  and this makes me happy
                  <br/>
                  but it is not real love
                  <br/>
                  but felt as such

                  <br/> <br/>

                  must be compounded with racial justice
                  <br/>
                  recognition of the colonization of a musical form
                  <br/>
                  a mode of expression

                  <br/> <br/>

                  to combine two different worlds
                  <br/>
                  one of dominance
                  <br/>
                  and one of convinced dominance
                  <br/>
                  you decide which is which
                  <br/>
                  because to succeed means to convince means to resonate
                  <br/>
                  your sound
                  <br/>
                  your world of inner thoughts with the outside one
                  <br/>
                  and when they don’t mesh
                  <br/>
                  it doesn't work out
                  <br/>
                  simple like that
                  <br/>
                  record deals don’t come easily and
                  <br/>
                  you're convinced music is white
                  <br/>
                  because that’s what comes across on home pages
                  <br/>
                  and in homes
                  <br/>
                  raised brought up down anywhere

                  <br/> <br/>

                  what does it mean to see yourself in the world
                  <br/>
                  and be surrounded by others who have nothing in common with you
                  <br/>
                  the balance between the two
                  <br/>
                  manifests magic
                  <br/>
                  in art<br/>
                  music
                  <br/>
                  something that lasts longer than human strife and turmoil
                  <br/>
                  what’s worth noting?
                  <br/>
                  what’s worth advancing in the name of music?<br/>
                  for all humans?

                  <br/> <br/>

                  and i am supposed to fight for you<br/>
                  i know that you would abuse my sisters’ bodies<br/>
                  but i stay true to you anyway<br/>
                  because looking back plagues us<br/>
                  but let’s talk about this<br/>
                  the complexity of the human mind<br/>
                  i can love your mind<br/>
                  your creations so much<br/>
                  and recognize the harm you caused to other people<br/>
                  and their existences

                  <br/> <br/>

                  it is not black and white<br/>
                  i do not like that saying<br/>
                  how unbridled by rhythm and racism<br/>
                  i don’t want to believe they intersect

                  <br/> <br/>

                  the inner and outer worlds<br/>
                  who we are and what we’re dependent upon<br/>
                  and i want to believe you are good<br/>
                  because you have loved many<br/>
                  and have helped many to love<br/>
                  but i don’t know<br/>
                  keep asking questions<br/>
                  fiddling with the middle of two worlds<br/>
                  where they meet<br/>
                  african<br/>
                  electronic music<br/>
                  it’s not inorganic<br/>
                  perhaps not the conglomerate<br/>
                  quite the opposite

                  <br/> <br/>

                  what do i think about<br/>
                  fela kuti<br/>
                  or janelle monae <br/>
                  or the natural trajectories<br/>
                  of human growth<br/>
                  inclusion and<br/>
                  reflection<br/>
                  i suppose the room i have to think<br/>
                  is only reflected if i take action to secure<br/>
                  lack of hypocrisy<br/>
                  more growth in my own outlook of music and the world<br/>
                  am i even allowed an opinion<br/>
                  how do i take this part of me?<br/>
                  this large part of my identity<br/>
                  how i exist on the planet<br/>
                  and couple it with<br/>
                  reflecting on worlds i just begin to know as i write<br/>
                  this.
